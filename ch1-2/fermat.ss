; Fermat's Little Theorem
; If 'n' is a prime number and 'a' is any positive integer less than 'n', then
; 'a' raised to the 'n'-th power is congruent to 'a' modulo 'n'.
; Eg: (a^n) / n = x remainder a
;     (a^n) â‰¡ a mod n

; We can also test for primality using Fermat's theorem. Given a number 'n',
; pick a random number 'a < n', and compute the remainder of 'a^n' modulo 'n'.
; If the result is not equal to 'a', then 'n' is certainly not a prime. If it is
; 'a', then chances are good that 'n' is a prime. Now repeat with another random
; number 'a' and test it with the same method. If it also satisfies the
; equation, we can be more confident that 'n' is a prime. This algorithm is
; known as the Fermat test.

; To implement the Fermat test, we need a procedure that computes the
; exponential of a number modulo another number.
