; Exercise 2.71
; Huffman trees for alphabet of 'n' symbols
; with relative frequencies of the symbols as 1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(n - 1)

; How many bits are required to encode the most frequent symbol? 1 (always)
; How many bits are required to encode the least frequent symbol? n - 1 bits

; For n = 5, least frequent symbol being 1 (1),
; requires n - 1 bits to encode: 4
