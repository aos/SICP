; Exercise 3.26
; Using a binary tree

; The (key, value) records would essentially stay the same. However,
; the backbone of the list would instead become a three item list (as in the
; deque), where the first points to the item, second points left, third points
; right

; However, since this is a binary tree, we would need to instantiate it with a
; 'middle' point that becomes the root for which to start searching from.
