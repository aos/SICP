; Exercise 4.19

; From an imperative standpoint, Ben's sequential definition makes the most
; sense, as at the time (f 10) is called, a is defined to 1 and then a is
; redefined to be 5.

; Alyssa's makes the most sense in a functional/declarative style that I
; admittedly am still learning.

; Eva's makes sense, but I do not know how to devise a way such that internal
; definitions are mutually recursive.
